Execute with following commands:
javac Dijkstra.java
java Dijkstra input.txt n

* n is which vertex you want to begin with / ex: java Dijkstra input.txt 0 * 

This program will print out all the shortest paths by using Dijkstra algorithm
from your begin vertex to all other vertexes

Input.txt data entering guide:
+ First line: Ammount of vertexes
+ Second line: Ammount of Edges
+ Third line onward: sourceVertex destinationVertex edgeLength


Output will be demonstrated like this:
sourceV_to_desV_(totalPathLength)_progress
